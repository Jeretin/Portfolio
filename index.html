                    <p>Red Milk is a horror game made by Unreal Engine where you wake up in the barn and have to get out there alive</p>
                    <p>
                        Red Milk was my second game made by Unreal Engine. In the project I wanted to learn more about AI and that's why I focused on making the AI for the game. Game has two AI characters:
                        one that chases you and one friend that you need to save. I learned a lot from the project and while I'm not totally happy with the enemy AI I made, I do know now what I would do next
                        better. For example, I don't think the game needed as complex AI character as I tried to make. AI doesn't have to work perfectly when player doesn't see it. Sometimes it's okay to make player
                        think that the AI works more complex than it actually does.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also made some smaller things like part of movement system, one number combination lock minigame and I put some of the sounds in game. AI sounds and background voices. There is videos of
                        those seen by clicking the picture on the left.

                        Brews & Brawls was my first game project made for VR. It was a new experience for me and it teached me a lot. I wasn't very familiar with Unreal Engine either. I had done one
                        very small project with it year before but almost everything was forgotten already. Most of the project was learning how to use Unreal Engine and how to make things work in VR.
                        I didn't make much for the project but I learned a lot about working with the engine. I studied Unreal Engine's destruction system and how to break objects in VR with it.

                        Ranger's Reserve is a city builder game developed for android. In the game you can buy habitat's where you put animals living in. By leveling up
                        you can access more animals and habitats. You can also feed the animals and level them up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game was my first and currently only game developed for mobile devices. Also making a city builder game was a new experience for me. Along with those I learned
                        a lot new stuff about programming on C# and Unity. I learned how to use dictionaries and lists to make the game more efficient and to make different animals and habitats more logically.
                        Also, all the names of animals are made by me. I'm the one you can blame for those.

                        I have growing interest in Artificial Intelligence and I have done some focusing to it. I am doing my thesis about using AI in game development and I have also done some AI for projects.

                        Behind the scenes of the game development, or like normal people would say, on my freetime, I like to play games, do sports, travel and do some other stuff. Mostly, I like to do fun stuff. 
                        On the right side you see a slideshow about me. That's to show you what I mean with fun stuff so I don't have to write it all here. I have heard that pictures tells you more than thousand words.
